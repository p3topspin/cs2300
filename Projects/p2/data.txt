For all the noise yesterday\u200a\u2014\u200aa deal was never likely. Yesterday was not\u200a\u2014\u200aas I repeatedly noted\u200a\u2014\u200aa \u2018hard\u2019 deadline.\r\n\r\n2. Counterintuitive as it seems, two meeting breaking up without an agreement and all the aggressive and unhelpful rhetoric on both sides may prove helpful. Both sides have won themselves credibility with their domestic audiences. Neither has obviously blinked.\r\n\r\n3. The ECB\u2019s actions two weeks ago in disallowing the use of Greek government bonds as collateral for borrowing but still supporting Greek banks through emergency liquids assistance (ELA), now looks smart. If they hadn\u2019t done it then, they would have to now. And that would look like an escalation.\r\n\r\nI think, odd as it may seem, a deal is close.\r\n\r\nIt would be based around the leaked Moscovici draft from yesterday.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s how it would play out\u200a\u2014\u200aGreece swallows some pride and asks for an extension.\r\n\r\nThe deal gives Greece 4\u20136 months of financing. Syriza hold back on implementing some of their manifesto and continue to run a hunky primary surplus.\r\n\r\nIn the next few months a wide ranging deal is negotiated.\r\n\r\nBoth sides have compromised.\r\n\r\nThere is also a fall back, less optimistic scenario that is still short for disaster: the bailout expires on the 28th and in March Greece requests a new one. That allows the talks to get off to a fresh start but may require capital controls in the interim to prevent a large deposit flow from Greek banks.\r\n\r\nWhat are the risks? I can see 2.\r\n\r\nThe first is what I yesterday called the Troika \u2018hard ball\u2019 strategy. That requires the ECB to up the ante by pulling ELA support from Greek banks. In those circumstances, faced with a banking collapse, Greece could be pushed out of the euro.\r\n\r\nThe second might be termed the \u2018Greek impasse\u2019 scenario. In this case the ECB doesn\u2019t escalate but Greece refuses to come back to the table. The bailout ends, deposit pressure leads to capital controls and the Greek government starts to run out if cash by the early summer at the latest. Uncertainty hammers the Greek economy.\r\n\r\nAny of this scenarios could play out. But the odds of a compromise that keep Greece in the Eurozone and is facing saving for both sides remains high.\r\nSource: https:\/\/medium.com\/bull-market\/greece-the-deal-the-risks-20cf9abc551a\r\nImage: http:\/\/chinesetouristagency.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/Santorini-Greece-5.jpg","http:\/\/chinesetouristagency.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/Santorini-Greece-5.jpg","February 18, 2015",0],["The Green Button Energy Data Movement Grows Up","Nick Sinai","Science","Back in September 2011, then U.S. CTO Aneesh Chopra and I convened the CIOs of the three large California electric utilities, along with colleagues from the Energy and Commerce Departments. At a meeting in the Bay Area, all three CIOs agreed to a pilot project to make detailed energy data available for download by their customers.\r\n\r\nThe California utility companies had been working for years to develop a data standard that would allow customers to download and transfer their own energy data. Let\u2019s be honest\u200a\u2014\u200aenergy data by itself isn\u2019t very exciting\u200a\u2014\u200abut what is exciting are the innovations that use that data. Armed with information about their energy usage, customers can more easily use virtual energy audit software, shop for solar, and reduce their energy bills.\r\n\r\nWith our encouragement and support, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric launched within 90 days, and Southern California Edison shortly thereafter. Over time, many other utilities across the country have also pledged to adopt the common standard for energy data export and transfer. Now, three and a half years later, over 100 million Americans have access to what is known as \u201cGreen Button\u201d data.\r\n\r\nWhat is \u201cGreen Button,\u201d and why does it matter to customers? It\u2019s really shorthand for three complementary things:\r\n\r\n1. The policy idea that customers deserve access to their own energy data. Your rate-payer (and sometimes tax-payer) dollars pay for smart meters and smart grid technologies\u200a\u2014\u200awhy shouldn\u2019t you be able to view, download, and transmit your own energy data to whoever you want? The Obama administration has made this a clear policy principle in U.S. smart grid policy, building off the ideas in the FCC\u2019s National Broadband Plan. So have state regulatory commissions and local governments. This concept is part of the larger Obama administration focus on data accessibility and portability through its My Data Initiatives.\r\n\r\n2. An informal but collaborative public private partnership between federal government, state regulators, utilities, and the innovation community to make data available for customers\u200a\u2014\u200ain a way that is both secure and private, while still useful for customers and the apps and services they trust. Recognizing that privacy is an important issue, the federal government convened industry, state regulators, and privacy advocates to develop a voluntary privacy code of conduct that President Obama recently highlighted.\r\n\r\n3. An actual data standard for making the data standard and machine-readable, either as a downloaded XML file or through an API. Green Button is an industry-developed standard, created in an open and consensus-based process.\r\n\r\nSo what\u2019s next for the Green Button initiative?\r\n\r\nLast Friday, at San Diego Gas &amp; Electric\u2019s Energy Innovation Center, I was honored to speak at an event organized by the Department of Energy and the National Institute of Standards and Technology to highlight the progress of the Green Button ecosystem, including the launch of the Green Button Alliance, a new industry consortium designed to accelerate adoption of the Green Button standard and administer testing and certification programs to make it easier for a developer to a write a single app that works across many utilities.\r\n\r\nAt the event, utility executives discussed their progress with Green Button and outlined their product roadmaps. I was excited to see how companies like C3 Energy and Schneider Electric are incorporating the Green Button standard into their software products at a massive scale.\r\n\r\nPG&amp;E\u2019s Andrew Green talked about the plans to use Green Button Connect My Data with modern Internet technologies (RESTful APIs and OAuth2.0) later this year to make it easier for you to securely send your energy data to a solar or energy efficiency company on a one-time or recurring basis.\r\n\r\nCanada has entered the game too. London Hydro CIO Syed Mir talked about how his utility has implemented Green Button and also moved to the Google cloud, and how the Green Button standard and others could be the basis of smart thermostats and other smart home technologies.\r\n\r\nBut it isn\u2019t just the big guys. Smaller app companies showcased creative products built on Green Button data. John Horn, an analyst at the non-profit Center for Sustainable Energy, explained that he built a Green Button-enabled solar calculator app in less than 50 hours. His solar calculator lets you upload your Green Button energy usage data, and uses open data from the Department of Energy about rates and solar irradiance to give you an accurate prediction of your ROI if you install solar.\r\n\r\nU.S. CTO Megan Smith even made an appearance virtually with inspiring video remarks, thanking industry for collaborating together to make Green Button energy data useful across a range of applications\u200a\u2014\u200afrom household energy usage competitions on Facebook to high-end data analytics in commercial buildings.\r\n\r\nStay tuned. With a third annual Energy Datapalooza expected later this year, we\u2019re just beginning to see the innovation that can emerge from Green Button data.\r\n\r\nNick Sinai is an inaugural Walter Shorenstein Media and Democracy Fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School\u2019s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy.

While programmers proclaim logic as their domain, they are only sometimes and slightly better at managing complexity than the rest of us, mortals. The more logic our app has, the harder it is to change it or introduce new people to it.\r\n\r\nThe most common mistake programmers do is assuming they write code for a machine to read. While technically that is true, this mindset leads to the hell that is other people\u2019s code.\r\n\r\nI have worked in several start-up companies, some of them even considered \u201clean.\u201d In each, it took me between few weeks to few months to fully understand their code-base, and I have about 6 years of experience with JavaScript. This does not seem reasonable to me at all.\r\n\r\nIf the code is not easy to read, its structure is already a monument\u2014you can change small things, but major changes\u2014the kind every start-up undergoes on an almost monthly basis\u2014are as fun as a root canal. Once the code reaches a state, that for a proficient programmer, it is harder to read than this article\u2014doom and suffering is upon you.\r\n\r\nWhy does the code become unreadable? Let\u2019s compare code to plain text: the longer a sentence is, the easier it is for our mind to forget the beginning of it, and once we reach the end, we forget what was the beginning and lose the meaning of the whole sentence. You had to read the previous sentence twice because it was too long to get in one grasp? Exactly! Same with code. Worse, actually\u2014the logic of code can be way more complex than any sentence from a book or a blog post, and each programmer has his own logic which can be total gibberish to another. Not to mention that we also need to remember the logic. Sometimes we come back to it the same day and sometimes after two month. Nobody remembers anything about their code after not looking at it for two month.\r\n\r\nTo make code readable to other humans we rely on three things:\r\n\r\n1. Conventions\r\n\r\nConventions are good, but they are very limited: enforce them too little and the programmer becomes coupled to the code\u2014no one will ever understand what they meant once they are gone. Enforce too much and you will have hour-long debates about every space and colon (true story.) The \u201chabitable zone\u201d is very narrow and easy to miss.\r\n\r\n2. Comments\r\n\r\nThey are probably the most helpful, if done right. Unfortunately many programmers write their comments in the same spirit they write their code\u2014very idiosyncratic. I do not belong to the school claiming good code needs no comments, but even beautifully commented code can still be extremely complicated.\r\n\r\n3. \u201cOther people know this programming language as much as I do, so they must understand my writings.\u201d\r\n\r\nWell\u2026 This is JavaScript:\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is JAVASCRIPT!\r\n4. Tests\r\n\r\n\r\nTests.\r\nTests are a devil in disguise. \u201dHow do we make sure our code is good and readable? We write more code!\u201d I know many of you might quit this post right here, but bear with me for a few more lines: regardless of their benefit, tests are another layer of logic. They are more code to be read and understood. Tests try to solve this exact problem: your code is too complicated to calculate it\u2019s result in your brain? So you say \u201cwell, this is what should happen in the end.\u201d And when it doesn\u2019t, you go digging for the problem. Your code should be simple enough to read a function or a line and understand what should be the result of running it.\r\n\r\nYour life as a programmer could be so much easier!\r\n\r\nSolution: Radical Minimalism\r\n\r\nMacro film photo from an old CRT display\r\nI will break down this approach into practical points, but the main idea is: use LESS logic.\r\n\r\nCut 80% of your product\u2019s features\r\nYes! Just like that. Simplicity, first of all, comes from the product. Make it easy for people to understand and use. Make it do one thing well, and only then add up (if there is still a need.)\r\n\r\nUse nothing but what you absolutely must\r\nDo not include a single line of code (especially from libraries) that you are not 100% sure you will use and that it is the simplest, most straightforward solution available. Need a simple chat app and use Angular.js because it\u2019s nice with the two-way binding? You deserve those hours and days of debugging and debating about services vs. providers.\r\n\r\nSide note: The JavaScript browser api is event-driven, it is made to respond when stuff (usually user input) happens. This means that events change data. Many new frameworks (Angular, Meteor) reverse this direction and make data changes trigger events. If your app is simple, you might live happily with the new mysterious layer, but if not\u200a\u2014\u200ayou get a whole new layer of complexity that you need to understand and your life will get exponentially more miserable. Unless your app constantly manages big amounts of data, Avoid those frameworks.\r\n\r\nUse simplest logic possible\r\nSay you need show different HTML on different occasions. You can use client-side routing with controllers and data passed to each controller that renders the HTML from a template. Or you can just use static HTML pages with normal browser navigation, and update manually the HTML. Use the second.\r\n\r\nMake short Javascript files\r\nLimit the length of your JS files to a single editor page, and make each file do one thing. Can\u2019t cramp all your glorious logic into small modules? Good, that means you should have less of it, so that other humans will understand your code in reasonable time.\r\n\r\nAvoid pre-compilers and task-runners like AIDS\r\nThe more layers there are between what you write and what you see, the more logic your mind needs to remember. You might think grunt or gulp help you to simplify stuff but then you have 30 tasks that you need to remember what they do to your code, how to use them, update them, and teach them to any new coder. Not to mention compiling.\r\n\r\nSide note #1: CSS pre-compilers are OK because they have very little logic but they help a lot in terms of readable structure, compared to plain CSS. I barely used HTML pre-compilers so you\u2019ll have to decide for yourself.\r\n\r\nSide note #2: Task-runners could save you time, so if you do use them, do it wisely keeping the minimalistic mindset.\r\n\r\nUse Javascript everywhere\r\nThis one is quite specific, and I am not absolutely sure about it, but having the same language in client and server can simplify the data management between them.\r\n\r\nWrite more human code\r\nGive your non trivial variables (and functions) descriptive names. Make shorter lines but only if it does not compromise readability.\r\n\r\nTreat your code like poetry and take it to the edge of the bare minimum.\r\n\r\nSource: https:\/\/medium.com\/@ilyothehorrid\/writing-code-for-humans-5b80a89f439c","https:\/\/d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net\/max\/1199\/1*gA2bxuhjURf56uVhqXtoSQ.jpeg","February 18, 2015",0],["The False Market Fit","Trevor Gilbert","Business","I was recently rereading Marc Andreessen\u2019s well-known essay on Product Market Fit, and it struck me that nearly 7 years later, I still hear about companies that seem to be ignoring (or are ignorant of) the advice he shared.\r\n\r\nHis entire post is worth reading (go read it), but the key part is that many startups fail because they never reach product-market fit. Instead, they put the priority of their attention not on the market, but on the team or the product. In doing this, they fail to recognize something of critical importance: because the startup must exist in the Market and will be defined by it, it must focus on the Market and not exclusively on the internal machinations of the Product and Team.\r\n\r\nNow, looking at many startups that get attention, you\u2019d think that they have at least a somewhat decent understanding of The Market. VCs are bought in, the press is pandering, top-notch job applications are pouring in. They may even have a small, impassioned user base. All signals point towards a future where the great ideas are met by a receptive Market, the world is made better, and everyone\u2019s wallets come away a bit thicker.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for the company, the Market they\u2019ve been accepted by isn\u2019t \u201cThe Market of Customers\u201d, but rather \u201cThe Market of Engineers\/Designers\/VCs\/Reporters\/etc.\u201d Or in my shorthand, The Market of Team.\r\n\r\nMy hypothesis is that this misunderstanding of who they\u2019re being accepted by, and how important that acceptance is, causes many companies to fail and never reach True Product Market Fit.\r\n\r\nWhy is this situation so dangerous? Because while you\u2019re moving towards this False-PMF, there\u2019s a high probability that you\u2019re moving away from what the True Market really wants. Is the Team a subset of the True Market? Maybe! But it\u2019s also a statistically insignificant subset of the Market.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut my team is really smart, and they love the product!\u201d Great! They\u2019re also biased. Just consider the standard difference between the experiences and mentality of your average Silicon Valley Engineer, and your average Facebook\/Snapchat\/Twitter\/etc. user. It\u2019s like asking the Saudi King what the average day in his country is like. Will it be interesting? Sure. Will it be representative? No.\r\n\r\nUnless you want your market to just be the maximum number of people that are similar to your team\u200a\u2014\u200aor worse, just members of your team\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s important to realize the distinction between Team and Market, and put more weight on the latter.\r\n\r\nIn real life situations, it\u2019s not going to be cut-and-dry. It\u2019s not that The Market is going to say \u201cbuild this\u201d and that The Team will say \u201cno, let\u2019s build this opposite thing\u201d. Instead, you\u2019ll likely start by listening to different Market signals and begin planning accordingly.\r\n\r\nThen, you\u2019ll get sidetracked by the everyday concerns that are raised by team members with strong beliefs. \u201cThis is more technologically elegant,\u201d \u201cI personally would love this feature,\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t think of a single person who would want this,\u201d \u201cWe need to get something out the door immediately.\u201d You\u2019ve remained focused on The Market, just the wrong one. You end up in the mire.\r\n\r\nThis isn\u2019t an unavoidable situation, it just requires a bit of extra attention to what you\u2019re focusing on. I\u2019m as guilty as the next person at getting distracted by things that seem to be important, only to find out too late that I\u2019ve been waylaid by the immaterial.\r\n\r\nAll you need to do is focus on what the True Market wants, hear from the customers of The Market, and purposefully shape yourself to fit the Market, not the Team.\r\n\r\nSource: https:\/\/medium.com\/@trevoragilbert\/the-false-market-fit-44b8299c8f9c","http:\/\/www.tarcherbooks.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/social-media-marketing-spout.jpg","February 18, 2015",0],["And Then There Were Two","Martta Rose Kelly","World","Reflections on Losing a Sibling\r\n\r\nIn one of my desk drawers is a birthday card picturing two elderly men where one says to the other, \u201cI\u2019m thinking about getting a tattoo. His friend asks, \u201cYeah? What kind? A skull? A naked woman?\u201d \u201cMy name and address,\u201d he answers. \u2018I ain\u2019t getting any younger, y\u2019know!\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\nThis is a card I bought a year ago for my oldest brother, Leon, a card that I never got to send. Leon\u2019s birthday was February 17; he passed away on February 8, 2013, a few days shy of his 71st.\r\n\r\nI will never send this card to anyone else. This was Leon\u2019s card and if he can\u2019t have it, no one else will. It was a brand of humor we both shared. No sappy sweet Hallmark moments for us.\r\nI cannot believe it\u2019s been a year already since he\u2019s gone. I am fortunate that my other brother, Bob, and I were able to be with him when he was called home.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s weird losing a sibling. You understand, sadly, that you will lose your parents one day. You think about it more and more it as you reach middle age and find yourself the caregiver of one or both of them. It\u2019s not a matter of if, but when. But if you are like me, you don\u2019t often imagine your life without a sibling, not being able to pick up the phone and hear their voice any longer, no matter how far away they live.\r\n\r\nLosing a sibling throws you off balance. First there were three, now there are two. The three of us will never be together again, at least in this life.\r\n\r\nLeon was a wonderful big brother, 15 years my senior. He was in the Army at Fort Dix when I was in the first grade. We didn\u2019t always see eye to eye on everything but we respected and loved one another. He was generous to a fault, the kind of person that, if he liked you, he would do anything for you. As his sister, I can\u2019t count the number of times he\u2019s helped me out with financial advice, everything from buying a car to refinancing a mortgage. Our home is filled with furniture and electronic devices he gifted to us. He often gave me advice on my love life when I needed it. When I complained about a guy I was dating, back in my single days, he simply asked, \u201cWhy are you looking for a kielbasa in a hardware store?\u201d A simple, funny response that made perfectly good sense to me.\r\n\r\nNone of us know when we\u2019re going to die but it\u2019s often said that one should live as if they were going to die within six months. This was true about my brother as he lived his life to the fullest, dining in the best places, vacationing at top resorts, and driving the sports cars he couldn\u2019t afford as a younger man. No one will ever say that he didn\u2019t how to have a good time. He truly chose to seize the day while he was here on Earth.\r\n\r\nI knew my brother was tough but it was never as apparent as it was in his final days. He lived longer than expected and amazed everyone around him, including his doctors. Through it all, his indomitable spirit prevailed and I rarely heard him complain. When he no longer wanted to endure the agony of his treatments, he bravely made the choice to stop them, choosing instead to die peacefully, with dignity. Leon, may you rest in peace. I love you and miss you.\r\n\r\nSource:\r\nhttps:\/\/medium.com\/midcentury-modern\/and-then-there-were-two-d4d1f470afcb","https:\/\/d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net\/max\/791\/1*uVwn5Jk4fkJOuUYWzapxJQ.jpeg","February 18, 2015",0],["Jony Ive Is a Redwood","Jon Bell","Tech","Is Apple\u2019s success reproducible? Is their design culture? Is Jony Ive? After years of debate, my friend and I finally had a breakthrough last week. The answer transcends a tidy yes or no\u200a\u2014\u200ainstead, think of Jony Ive as a redwood.\r\n\r\nOn one hand, of course Apple\u2019s success is reproducible. They\u2019re just a bunch of people in a company trying to make products, same as anyone. Every company has a workforce and the ability to hire talented people. Every company can invest in their future and set a high bar for quality. The playbook is there. Of course it can be copied.\r\n\r\nBut no, no company really does. I don\u2019t consider any company \u201cdesign led\u201d other than Apple. Everyone has designers. Everyone has engineers. Everyone talks about quality. Everyone talks about delighting customers. But to date I haven\u2019t seen anyone but Apple reliably have true design courage. It\u2019s all talk.\r\n\r\nSo anyone could theoretically reproduce what Apple has done over the years, but I don\u2019t believe anyone actually has. Why not? Let\u2019s look to nature to understand what might be going on here. Or rather, what has gone on at Apple for nearly twenty-five years.\r\n\r\nImagine driving into beautiful Marin County, in the Bay Area, and cutting down a redwood to transport to your backyard. You\u2019d take great care to dig out all the roots and do everything possible to transfer the tree successfully. Now, I don\u2019t know much about trees but I\u2019m going to assume this kind of thing is impossible. The redwood wouldn\u2019t survive in its new environment.\r\n\r\nThis is what would happen to Jony Ive if you sent him to Google, Microsoft, Facebook, or any other company in the world. You could try to make him comfortable, you could try to recreate the environment that grew him, but it wouldn\u2019t work. If anything, it would take another twenty-five years, and in that time he'd fail to thrive. It wouldn\u2019t be the first time.\r\n\r\nJony Ive of 1992 was talented, but he was still young and ineffectual. For years he made little impact at \u201cbeleagured\u201d Apple Computer. He was near quitting when before Steve Jobs returned, discovered him, and said \u201cFuck, you\u2019ve not been very effective, have you?\u201d No, he hadn\u2019t been. The 90's version of Apple Computer wasn\u2019t healthy enough for Jony Ive.\r\n\r\nBut Jony Ive and modern Apple, the one we know today, grew strong together. The early work was unremarkable, but showed promise. It just took time, lots and lots of time, to build up to something truly great. The company needed Jony Ive, and he needed the company. Over two decades later, here we are. Leaving others to wonder \u201chow can we get some of that?\u201d\r\n\r\nAnother company could do it. They just have to invest heavily in creating the right conditions. They need to think decades ahead rather than one quarter out. They need to trust in only shipping products when they\u2019re ready, not because a pre-determined date has been reached. And then they need to execute reliably and at a high level of quality. For decades. Think of it as 80 quarterly earnings reports, minimum.\r\n\r\nSo it\u2019s possible to grow a redwood, at least in theory. All the Jony Ives of the future are already on their design teams right now. Which ones will quit their jobs in frustration, as Jony almost did? Which ones will find a way to become giants? Their destiny isn\u2019t just in the seeds, their raw talent. Reaching these heights depends on the environment employees are put in. And that\u2019s up to the company cultures that can best grow them.\r\n\r\nSource: https:\/\/medium.com\/@ienjoy\/jony-ive-is-a-redwood-470ad3267529","https:\/\/d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net\/max\/2000\/1*nQqk36quhhe8MeVTK9L4iA.jpeg","February 18, 2015",0],["Tell a four word story","James Buckhouse","Business","Forget the elevator pitch.

Yes, it\u2019s arbitrarily too hard to be reasonable, but try it! \r\n\r\nHere\u2019s my take on a few well-known companies:\r\n\r\nPinterest: Organize everything you love.\r\nFacebook: Hear from your friends.\r\nGoogle: Easily find useful information.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s no better way to force a conversation about what your team values than to write your four-word story.\u201d\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s a step-by-step workshop you can try during your next team meeting. \r\n\r\nStep 1:\r\nStart by brainstorming all the words you can think of that relate to your company. Put them in a big pile. Keep going. Get dozens. Lump them all together. Don\u2019t say no to any of them yet. Brainstorm. \r\n\r\nStep2:\r\nEliminate some that are a little off the mark. Then organize the rest into groups. You might have one group of words that talks about people or users or customers. You might have another that talks about your advantages, such as real-time, reliable, or proprietary. Keep going until you have all the words in groups.\r\n\r\nStep3:\r\nConsolidate the groups until you only have four. Pick an \u201cessential\u201d word that best encapsulates the meaning of the group. \r\n\r\nStep4:\r\nWrite down your four words and re-arrange until they start to form the structure of a sentence. Start with this proto-sentence. Now re-write until you have your golden four. \r\n\r\nStep5:\r\nTest the sentence. Does it hold up to what you actually value? Can you substitute out any of the words for better ones? Try it out on one of your toughest business questions: Does it help you decide which way forward? Not happy with the results? Iterate. When you get it, you\u2019ll know. \r\n\r\nMore\u2026\r\nWe build better when we work together. Here\u2019s how\r\n\r\nDraw the human need your product solves.

As local meteorologists prepare for inordinate amounts of screen time, you should make ready for the coming storm. Here are some important tips to help you survive the storm of the century. Stock up on jokes about milk and bread. There\u2019s going to be a lot of opportunity to make jokes about people running to the store for necessities in the face of winter weather. You\u2019re going to want cutting edge, fresh jokes so that yours can stand out on social media. Don\u2019t be stuck with just one \u201cGuess we\u2019re going to need bread and milk!\u201d quip for Facebook. Go get those jokes ready now so you can be at the forefront of obvious comedy. Winterize your house. Cover the entire house with a Styrofoam teepee. If it\u2019s good enough for your outdoor faucets, it\u2019s good enough for your whole house. Determine which family members you will eat. If trapped by ice for more than two days, you may need to decide which family member the rest will eat in order to survive. It\u2019s best to make those plans now when you can do it rationally and without letting emotions get in the way during a crisis. The Donner party didn\u2019t plan, and reports say they had a really hard time deciding who would be lunch. And don\u2019t even get me started on that soccer team. Those guys had a really tough time due to lack of planning! Purchase a salt truck and 50 tons of salt. This will be incredibly useful. And if the storm does not show up, you\u2019ve got enough salt to last for your meals for at least a week! Mock people. If you are from the North, now is your opportunity to make fun of and be condescending to your new neighbors. Make as many insulting, rude and annoying statements about how we just don\u2019t understand snow down here and that it\u2019s quaint that we react to winter weather the way we do. We love that. Gather costumes. Prepare for the winter weather by stocking up on supplies to make costumes of local weather personalities. Treat weather reports like The Rocky Horror Picture Show. Throw bread or something at your TV anytime there\u2019s a weather crawl! Shoot each other with water guns anytime the weather guy or gal says \u201coccluded\u201d! Make it fun! Prepare entertainment. Remember, if the power goes out, you won\u2019t be able to access programming on your TV, radios, Netflix, or even your old Magnum P.I. DVDs. So prepare for some non-electric based entertainment. Like puppets or something. I don\u2019t know what people did for fun in the dark ages, but I assume puppets were involved. Prepare a shrine to Ithaqua. Just in case the storm is caused by Old Ones, it won\u2019t hurt to do what you can to appease Ithaqua lest he devour your soul or send you to the brink of gibbering madness. Get a sled. Call it Rosebud and yearn for it as you lay dying, allowing it symbolize your lost youth and innocence. Spoiler alert. Sorry. Say \u201cCold enough for you?\u201d over and over again. This will help make the decision in number 3 easier for the rest of the family. Originally published at www.thehowlingmonkey.com on February 15, 2015.
